nn_term(3)
==========

NAME
----
nn_term - notify all sockets about process termination


SYNOPSIS
--------
*#include <nanomsg/nn.h>*

*void nn_term (void);*


DESCRIPTION
-----------
To help with shutdown of multi-threaded programs nanomsg provides the
_nn_term()_ function which informs all the open sockets that process
terminaion is underway.

If a socket is blocked inside a blocking function, such as
linknanomsg:nn_recv[3], it will be unblocked  and ETERM error will be returned
to the user. Similarly, any subsequent attempt to invoke a socket function other
than linknanomsg:nn_close[3] after _nn_term()_ was called will result
in ETERM error.


EXAMPLE
-------

----
s = nn_socket (AF_SP, NN_PAIR);
nn_term ();
rc = nn_send (s, "ABC", 3, 0);
assert (rc == -1 && errno == ETERM);

SEE ALSO
--------
