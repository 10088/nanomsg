<p><i>nanomsg</i> library is a simple high-performance implementation of scalability layer ("scalability protocols" or "SP" for short) in the network stack.</p>

<p>Scalability protocol's job is to define how multiple applications communicate to form a single distributed application.</p>

<p>Arbitrary number of protocols (also known as "messaging patterns") live at scalability layer, however, <i>nanomsg</i> library at the moment implements the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>PAIR - simple one-to-one communication pattern
<li>REQREP - allows to build clusters of stateless services to process user requests
<li>PUBSUB - distributes messages to large sets of interested subscribers
<li>FANIN - aggregates messages from multiple sources
<li>FANOUT - load balances messages among many destinations
<li>SURVEY - allows to query state of multiple applications in one go
</ul>

<p>Scalability layer is layered on top of transport layer. At the moment, <i>nanomsg</i> library supports using scalability protocols on top of following transport protocols:</p>

<ul>
<li>INPROC - in-process, inter-thread or inter-module transport
<li>IPC - transport via UNIX domain sockets (or equivalent)
<li>TCP - network transport via TCP
</ul>

<p>While <i>nanomsg</i> performance strongly depends on the actual hardware and software stack, the end-to-end latency on modern systems is in order of microseconds and throughput is in order of millions of messages per second.</p>

<p><i>nanomsg</i> library is implemented in C and has no extra dependencies except for functionality natively provided by the operating system.</p>

<p>It provides the applications with a BSD-socket-like C API.</p>

<p><i>nanomsg</i> library can be used in both free and commercial applications. It is licensed under MIT/X11 license.</p>

<p><i>nanomsg</i> is fully supported by <a href="http://www.250bpm.com">250bpm</a>.</p>
