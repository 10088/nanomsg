NAME
----
sp_ipc - inter-process transport mechanism


SYNOPSIS
--------
*#include <sp/sp.h>*

*#include <sp/ipc.h>*


DESCRIPTION
-----------
Inter-process transport allows for sending messages between processes within
a single box. The implementation uses native IPC mechanism provided by the local
operating system and the IPC addresses are thus OS-specific.

On POSIX-compliant systems, UNIX domain sockets are used and IPC addresses are
file references. Note that both relative (ipc://test.ipc) and absolute
(ipc:///tmp/test.ipc) paths may be used. Also note that access rights on the IPC
files must be set in such a way that the appropriate applications can actually
use them.

On Windows, named pipes are used for IPC. IPC address is an arbitrary
case-insensitive string containing any character except for backslash.
Internally, address ipc://test means that named pipe \\.\pipe\test will be used.

EXAMPLE
-------

----
sp_bind (s1, "ipc:///tmp/test.ipc");
sp_connect (s2, "ipc:///tmp/test.ipc");
