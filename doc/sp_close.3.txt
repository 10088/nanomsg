sp_close(3)
===========

NAME
----
sp_close - close an SP socket


SYNOPSIS
--------
*#include <sp/sp.h>*

*int sp_close (int 's');*


DESCRIPTION
-----------
Closes the socket 's'. Any buffered inbound messages that were not yet received
by the application will be discarded. The library will try to deliver any
outstanding outbound messages for the time specified by _SP_LINGER_ socket
option. Such delayed sending will happen in the background and won't block
the thread calling _sp_close()_.


RETURN VALUE
------------
If the function succeeds zero is returned. Otherwise, negative number is
returned and 'errno' is set to to one of the values defined below.


ERRORS
------
*EFAULT*::
The library is not initialised.
*EBADF*::
The provided socket is invalid.


EXAMPLE
-------

----
int s = sp_socket (AF_SP, SP_PUB);
assert (s >= 0);
int rc = sp_close (s);
assert (rc == 0);
