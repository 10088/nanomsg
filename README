Welcome to nanomsg
------------------

Nanomsg is a project to help with building scalable and high performance 
distributed applications.

Nanomsg extends the standard socket interfaces with features 
traditionally provided by specialised messaging middleware products, 
providing multiple messaging patterns, seamless access to multiple 
transport protocols, message filtering (subscriptions) and more.

'nanomsg' library provides a native C API for applications.

    installed on your system
