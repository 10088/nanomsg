nn_term(3)
==========

NAME
----
nn_term - uninitialise the nanomsg library


SYNOPSIS
--------
*#include <nanomsg/nn.h>*

*int nn_term (void);*


DESCRIPTION
-----------
Uninitialises the nanomsg library. If the library was initialised multiple
times, it is uninitialised only when _nn_term()_ call is executed
for each corresponding linknanomsg:nn_init[3] call.

Calling _nn_term()_ without prior call to linknanomsg:nn_init[3] results in
undefined behaviour.

To help with shutdown of multi-threaded programs nanomsg permits to call
_nn_term()_ while some of the sockets are still open. In such case _nn_term()_
call blocks and waits while all the sockets are closed.

If a thread is blocked inside a blocking function, such as
linknanomsg:nn_recv[3], it will be unblocked once _nn_term()_ is called and
ETERM error will be returned to the user. Similarly, any attempt to invoke
a socket function other than linknanomsg:nn_close[3] after _nn_term()_ was
called will result in ETERM error.


RETURN VALUE
------------
Returns zero in case of success. Returns negative value in case of error and
sets 'errno' to to one of the values defined below.


ERRORS
------
No errors are defined.
